# Configure-UDPServer-as-a-DNS-server

Using the linux operating system in distro debian, UDPServer was configured as a DNS server, where the client sends a logical address to the server and the server returns the ip address or an error message if the ip is not found.

Endereço lógico   Endereço IP
ufmt.br          / 200.126.44.20
ifmt.br          / 179.84.112.99
rnp.br           / 210.21.10.20
capes.org        / 189.90.100.22

To test, just run the client and server file, and on the client test the logical addresses.
